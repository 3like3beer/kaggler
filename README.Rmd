1. Click `Account` or navigate to `https://www.kaggle.com/{username}/account`

## `kaggle_competitions_list_.*()`

Browse or search for Kaggle compeitions.

```{r complist}
## look through all competitions (paginated)
comps1 <- kaggle_competitions_list()

imagecomps <- kaggle_competitions_list(search = "image")
imagecomps
```

## data list for a given competition
c1_datalist <- kaggle_competitions_data_list(comps1$id[1])
c1_datalist

## download set sets (IF YOU HAVE ACCEPTED COMPETITION RULES)
c1_data <- kaggle_competitions_data_download(
  comps1$id[1], c1_datalist$name[1])
```

## `kaggle_datasets_.*()`

```{r datalist}
## get competitions data list
